# Hi, I’m Benji.

I’m supposed to be studying.

Hi, I’m Benji. You might know me as [@MindfulMinun][Twitter] online. I graduated from [Temple College][templejc] late last spring with an associate’s degree. I’m currently a first-year at [UT Dallas][utd], majoring in Computer Science. I like to [write code](/p/) and play the piano.

Check out some of the [things I’ve made](/p/), I promise you they’re *(kinda)* cool.

I love to code. It’s my dream to write code for a living. I picked up JavaScript during my freshman year of high school while messing around with Firefox Scratchpad. I naturally went on to learn the other two web languages, HTML and CSS. After 5 years, I’ve become fluent in front-end workflow, combining technologies ranging from client-side ServiceWorker to back-end Heroku, you name it.
